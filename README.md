## How to Play
1. Choose a number length (4, 6, or 8 digits) and number of rounds (2, 3, 4, or 5) from dropdowns.
2. Enter an initial number (e.g., 1234 for 4 digits, no leading zero).
3. See the magic guess (e.g., 21232 for 1234).
4. In each round, enter a number. The computer replies with the maximum number (e.g., 9999 for 4 digits) minus your number.
5. After all rounds, the sum of all numbers matches the magic guess!

**Example (4 digits, 2 rounds)**:
- Initial number: 1234
- Magic guess: 21232
- Round 1: You pick 5678, computer replies 4321 (9999 - 5678)
- Round 2: You pick 1111, computer replies 8888 (9999 - 1111)
- Sum: 1234 + 5678 + 4321 + 1111 + 8888 = 21232 (matches magic guess!)
